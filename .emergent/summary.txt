<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a clone of the website  but adapted for a computer repair business named Computer Repair Pros.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   The business is located in the Hills district of Sydney.
-   The website **must not** be made in React, but instead in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   It must be lightening fast and SEO-friendly (aligned with Google's font sizing, RankBrain, SpamBrain).
-   It must be super helpful and address customer pain points.
-   It needs to include a homepage, about page, contact page, and multiple service pages and area pages for all suburbs of the Hills district.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has created a full set of static HTML, CSS, and JS files for the website, including a homepage, about, contact, and numerous service and area pages. These files were placed in the  directory of a React project.

Initially, the static files wouldn't load due to the active React router. As a workaround, the agent modified  to perform a  to .

Following user feedback, the agent updated the CSS with a new blue color theme and modified  to include a new hero image and logo styling. The remaining pages have not yet been updated with the new design.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was about to update the contact page () to fix the form styling and add a hero image, as per the user's feedback. This is part of a larger task to apply a new design across all static pages.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool (to verify visual changes on the static HTML pages).
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** The project is being served by a React development server (), which contradicts the user's explicit requirement of a non-React website. The current solution of redirecting from  is a hack, not a proper fix. This causes unnecessary overhead and complexity.

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1: Incorrect Project Scaffolding for a Static Site**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent identified that the React router was blocking the static HTML files. The fix was to add  to . This works but is an inefficient and architecturally incorrect solution.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify if there's a simpler way to serve the  directory without involving the React build process.
        2.  Consider removing the React dependencies (, , , ) from  and replacing the  script with a simple static file server command (e.g., ).
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To align with the user's core requirement of a non-React site, improve performance, and simplify the project structure, making it a true static HTML/CSS/JS website.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The underlying problem will persist and may cause future issues).
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Apply New Design Across All Static Pages (P0)**

**Task Detail:**
*   **Task 1: Apply New Design Across All Static Pages**
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent has already updated  and . The next step is to update  as intended, followed by , and then all the service and area pages located in  and .
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** All pages will have a consistent blue color theme, an impactful logo, and a hero section with an appropriate image, addressing the user's specific design feedback. The broken contact form will also be fixed.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    *   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   None identified beyond completing the initial request.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Created a multi-page static website structure with plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
-   Generated pages for Homepage, About, Contact, Services (laptop repair, virus removal, data recovery etc.), and Areas (Castle Hill, Kellyville, Rouse Hill etc.).
-   Researched and compiled a list of suburbs in the Hills District.
-   Implemented a temporary redirect in  to serve the static content.
-   Updated the main stylesheet () with a blue color theme.
-   Updated the homepage () with a new hero section and image.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   **Issue 1: Using a React Dev Server for a Static Site**
    *   **Debug checklist:** See All Pending/In progress Issue list for details. The agent correctly identified the symptom (React app interfering with static files) but applied a workaround instead of fixing the root cause.
    *   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This will fulfill the user's primary constraint of a no React application, resulting in a faster, more lightweight, and architecturally correct project.
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend.
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**
A standard React project structure is in place, but it's being misused to serve a collection of static , , and  files located in . The entry point to the React app, , has been modified to immediately redirect the browser to .

**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
*   **Serving Mechanism:** A  (Create React App Configuration Override) development server is running, but only to serve the static files from the  folder via a redirect hack.

**key DB schema**
*   N/A (Frontend only).

**changes in tech stack**
*   None.

**All files of reference**
*   : The root directory for all static content.
    *   , , 
    *   
    *   
    *   : All service pages.
    *   : All area/location pages.
*   : Contains the redirect logic; this is the source of the architectural issue.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The entire project setup needs refactoring to remove the dependency on the React development server. The  redirect should be removed, and a simple static file server should be used instead to align with the user's request for a non-React site.

**key api endpoints**
*   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The most critical issue is the project's architecture. The user explicitly requested a website using **only HTML, CSS, and JS**, but the current implementation is a static site being served by a React development server. The redirect in  is a temporary hack. The next agent should prioritize addressing this by removing the React boilerplate and using a proper static file server. This will honor the user's core requirement and prevent future complications.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  Make the logo much more impactful and eye catching. Contact form is not looking correct. I need the same font as labiome. It must be in a blue hues theme colour. Every page must have a hero section with an appropriate image in hero section. - **Status: In Progress**

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** The serving mechanism is fundamentally flawed. A React development server is being used for a non-React site, which goes against the user's main constraint.
*   **Mocked:** N/A

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   None.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
*   **Test files created:** None.
*   **Known regressions:** The initial version failed to display the static HTML due to the React router.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent failed to establish a proper development and serving environment for a static HTML/CSS/JS website as requested. Instead of removing the unneeded React framework, it implemented a workaround, thus not fully adhering to the user's primary no React constraint.</analysis>
